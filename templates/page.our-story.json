But working in front of the camera demanded great skincare. I would get great DIY tips from top Hollywood makeup artists and Beverly Hills dermatologists. I continued my family's tradition and started making my own facial elixirs in my kitchen from crushed herbs, teas, oils, even fermenting my own fruits!<\/p><p>As I moved behind the camera as a professional photographer\/director, I stared at skin all day through the microscope of telephoto lenses and bright lights. I became even more determined to find out what was keeping certain women's skin dewy and bright while other women, even younger, had skin that was wrinkled, blotchy, and dull.<\/p><p>This passion has resulted in the supercharged, toxin-free, botanically rich recipes of all the IN YOUR FACE products. Good skin comes from eating plenty of veggies, avoiding processed foods, drinking more water, and having people in your life who encourage your dreams! Consume less. Walk more. Let go of the past. Sever unhealthy relationships. Drink green tea. Sweat every day. Shut off the TV. Help someone. Smile at strangers…and use IN YOUR FACE SKINCARE!<\/p>",
