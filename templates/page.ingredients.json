It also has a lower pH than other soaps, which helps the skin retain its natural moisture. Research shows that applying glycerin to your skin may gradually improve its smoothness and suppleness.

C Ester is fused with a fat-soluble carrier oil making the absorption highly effective. At the same time, free radicals cause signs of aging. They lead to dark spots on the skin and can damage the collagen and this leads to wrinkles, dark marks, and pigmentation problems. By using Vitamin C Ester topically, you can reduce the amount of aging you will see on your skin. The antioxidants will fight against the free radicals that will attack the damaged cells as they repair and grow again. You’ll also find it reduces redness and promotes new tissue growth as it helps build collagen. Vitamin C Ester increases the formation of elastin, which thickens, protects, and heals the skin cells. The thickening effect helps retain moisture, increases the skin circulation, and plumps up the skin surface. This wonder vitamin brings back a radiance and a glow to rough, blotchy skin!<\/p>\n<p>Products which contain this ingredient: <a href=\"\/collections\/all\/products\/the-cream\">CREAM<\/a>, <a href=\"\/collections\/all\/products\/radiant-detox-mineral-mask\">RADIANT DETOX MINERAL MASK<\/a><\/p>",
