It's completely non-comedogenic‚Äù would not be truthful as the term itself has ‚Äúmany loopholes and discrepancies‚Äù.<br\/><br\/>Here‚Äôs why:¬†The term \"non-comedogenic‚Äù unfortunately is not regulated. Any brand can claim that. There are a lot of companies that would like you to think, for example, that coconut oil is comedogenic, and to use their man-made mineral oils and silicones instead. There is a comedogenic scale from the 60‚Äôs and 70‚Äôs called \"rabbit ear tests\" where they used unrealistically high concentrations of product. There isn‚Äôt really a single definition for¬†non-comedogenic. Also so many other factors play a part like hormones and diet and climate.<br\/><br\/>But this isn‚Äôt to say that comedogenic ratings are completely unfounded, some comedogenic ingredients (such as isopropyl myristate, isopropyl palmitate, ethylhexyl palmitate, and acetylated lanolin) can absolutely cause breakouts in acne-prone skin if they're present at high enough concentrations.¬†<br\/><br\/><strong>Our¬†CREAM doesn‚Äôt have any of those ingredients<\/strong>. Sometimes active and effective skincare and treatments can stimulate skin to detox and purge clogged pores in which case those white heads come to the surface to be cleansed and removed without damage to the dermis. We have aesthetician customers who have experienced that with our¬†cream¬†revealing a smoother complexion within its a couple of weeks.<br\/><br\/>So it's definitely something that is very personal with your skin type. And we do offer a money back guarantee!<\/p>",

Give it a good 3 week try.

Our bottle and jars are usually a bit larger to allow for maximum-sized lid or cap for safety. ¬†As for protection from the air, rich oils like coconut and olive oil make an excellent preservation system for all ingredients in skincare formulas. Also, Vitamin E is used to prevent oxidation of oils as a preservative. Additionally, we have to plant-based preservative called Lactoperoxidase which is an enzyme derived from milk that also has unique properties to restore skin's surface flora as well as in the pores. And glucose oxidase is from raw sugar enzyme and it provides a complete and natural quality control for product anti-microbial stability with a solid two-year shelf life.<br\/><br\/>Considering we make our products in very small batches and only sell from our website for quality control and sell to very savvy, health-conscious customers who know to keep their plant-based products out of the window sills, there¬†have been no problems with the efficacy of our formula.
