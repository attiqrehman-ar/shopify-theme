            "text": "<p><strong><br\/>1.OVER EXFOLIATING<\/strong><\/p><p>Exfoliating is great for renewing skin by removing dead skin cells and increasing your rate of cell turnover. But there CAN be too much of a good thing! Daily face scrubs will not eliminate fine lines, wrinkles and acne and may actually be robbing your skin of its oils and moisture leaving your face feeling rough, dehydrated, and flaky.<br\/><\/p><p>The Fix: Our DEEP ENZYME CLEANSE is our non-abrasive, exfoliating glycolic acid and fruit enzyme wash that can be used 3-4 times a week because it is so gentle. It naturally helps produce radiant, healthy-looking skin melting away visible signs of aging into a youthful glow.<br\/><\/p><p><strong>2.OVERWASHING<\/strong><\/p><p>It may seem like the simplest part of your routine to wash your face, but too much washing can be drying and can strip your skin’s microbiome (healthy bacteria layer).<\/p><p>The Fix: If you’ve thoroughly cleansed your face in the evening and removed all traces of the day from your pores (including dirt, makeup, sebum, or any other impurities) there is really no need to wash your face again in the morning. A water splash or face mist is all you need before starting your skincare routine.<br\/><\/p><p><strong>3.SLEEPING WITH MAKEUP ON<\/strong><\/p><p>After a long day, you may just want to crash down on the bed and get some sleep. And that’s totally understandable - just be sure to remove your makeup first! Makeup can trap dirt and environmental toxins which can clog pores and add stress to the skin which can result in premature aging and collagen degradation, not to mention creating dull, dry skin and those “mystery” acne flareups!<br\/><\/p><p>The Fix: You will need an oil-based cleanser for hard-to-remove makeup and SPF.  Our MANDARIN MELT CLEANSING BALM, with restorative olive and coconut oils is a nourishing and emollient cleansing balm that melts away dirt from clogged pores, stubborn makeup, and SPF effortlessly without irritating skin or delicate eye area, leaving your skin ultra soft and radiant.<br\/><\/p><p><strong>4.APPLYING PRODUCTS IN THE WRONG ORDER<\/strong><\/p><p>Layering your products in the right order helps you get maximal absorption out of the active ingredients and incorrectly layering products won’t be as effective but can lead to irritation. For example, if you apply an aloe-based serum on top of a rich cream, you will not receive the full benefits of that serum because it can’t penetrate the skin because of the barrier of the rich cream.<\/p><p><\/p><p>The Fix: A good rule of thumb is to apply thinnest to thickest. Which means: you want to cleanse, then use a toner\/face mist, then apply serum, then apply eye gel, then apply oil or cream. During the day, your final step would be SPF. Proper application will save you money and boost results!<\/p><p><\/p><p><strong>5.SKIPPING YOUR MOISTURIZER<\/strong><\/p><p>As we grow older, our skin’s natural oil glands begin to produce less. And regardless of the season, because of climate control system (A\/C or heating), whether warm or cool, there is the potential to dry out your skin. When this happens, collagen and elastin fibers can grow stiff and break down, causing fine lines and wrinkles, dullness and even breakouts. Moisturizers serve as a shield from irritants and environmental pollutants improving tone, texture and appearance.<\/p><p><\/p><p>The Fix: Most of us don’t think about or have time to re-apply moisturizer during the day, so you want a rich, daily moisturizer that works well under makeup and gives you all-day hydration. Moisturizing every day can reduce the chance of extreme dryness or oiliness. THE CREAM is our 100% natural, rich, velvety moisturizer that is packed with botanical antioxidants, organic phytonutrients, and heavenly botanical essences.<\/p>",
